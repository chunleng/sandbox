# Sandbox

This is a repository where I experiment with code. Might contain incomplete
project, or maybe I might promote it to become my snippet or template in cookie
cutter. Who knows?

## Philosophy

A lot of codes I have written to test things are never preserved, and I will
think to myself, what did I do back then? This repository is meant to capture
every single things that I have tried, succeed or not

## Layout

Simply, folders of `Programming Language` followed by topic of experiment. For
example:

```text
.
└─ rust
  └─ tracing -> to test out Rust `tracing` library
```

## Project README

In order not to be confused with things that are working and things that are
not, each project has a `README.md` and after the description, A status section
to show whether I have failed parts in the project.
