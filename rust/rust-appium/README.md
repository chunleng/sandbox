# Rust Appium

This sandbox project explore the use of
[appium-client](https://docs.rs/appium_client/latest/appium_client) to perform
UI testing. This project is closely related to
[appium-simple](../../appium/appium-simple/) and use many of the knowledge that
I tested over there and replicate the setup that is done here.

## Status

WIP

## Getting Started

```bash
# Launch a server for testing
dx serve

# Run test (after launching appium server,
# see ../../appium/appium-simple/README.md on how to setup)
cargo test
```
